# Shopping cart ðŸš€

## Welcome!
Welcome to Shopping cart, in an app in which the data of the products of a database is observed. You can add the products you like in a cart and you can also view detailed product information.

- In the BITACORA.md file are the instructions to see and use this application.

**When making the inscriptions, you should be able to see the page that I show below.

## Technological stack
- Figma- Use this page, it is easy for me to make my prototypes here.
- React- I find it easy to be able to make the components, perform the functionality and also, the code is clean.

## Next steps
- Make the cart where it shows the products that are added, how many there are and the total price.
- Implement all the code using Redux.
